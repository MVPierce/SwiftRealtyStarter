# Swift Realty Starter Project

This is a basic Xcode starter project for the demo app called "SwiftRealty" - a basic app that will be written in Swift for Apple iPhones. The purpose of the app is to teach iOS developers how to integrate Amazon Web Services into their projects. The app will allow realtors from a real estate agency the ability to add listings with data and images, that will then be stored in AWS S3 and AWS DynamoDB. The users will also be able to fetch and view all saved listings.

## Prerequisites

- An iPhone running iOS 10.0 or higher (or a simulator equivalent)
- AWS Account - (You can use a free-tier account but will need a credit card to register)
- Basic iOS programming knowledge
